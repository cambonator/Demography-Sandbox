```{r}

# B19013_001 - median household income in past 12 months inflation adj
# B25104_001E - monthly housing costs
# B01003_001E - total population

# ACS with geometry
#
acs1_geo <- get_acs(geography = 'county', 
              variables = c("B01003_001E") ,
              state = "KY", 
              geometry = TRUE,survey='acs5',year=2015,keep_geo_vars=TRUE)

# looks like acs1 only covers more urban areas in KY,
# acs5 is comprehensive

```


```{r}
## Census API 
# this will not have geometries so we can join 
# with the prior ACS data to get that
#pop_vars <- listCensusMetadata("pep/population", vintage = 2016,type='v')
#pop_g <- listCensusMetadata("pep/population", vintage = 2016,type='g')

pep_pop <- getCensus("pep/population", 
    vintage = 2015, 
    region = "county", 
    regionin="state:21",
    vars = c("GEONAME", "SUMLEV","POP", "DENSITY"))
```


```{r}
# Merge datasets and check population differences
blend_1 <- left_join(acs1_geo,pep_pop,by=c("COUNTYFP" = "county"))
blend_1$POP <- as.numeric(blend_1$POP) # convert to numeric
blend_1$DENSITY <- as.numeric(blend_1$DENSITY) # convert to numeric
blend_1$pop_diff <- blend_1$POP - blend_1$estimate

# View a subset of our master file for spotchecking
