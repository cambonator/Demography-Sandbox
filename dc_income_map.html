  //    from the Image (using Context2D.getImageData()).
  // 3. Create a TileLayer.Canvas and add it to the map.

  // We want to synchronously create and attach the TileLayer.Canvas (so an
  // immediate call to clearRasters() will be respected, for example), but
  // Image loads its data asynchronously. Fortunately we can resolve this
  // by putting TileLayer.Canvas into async mode, which will let us create
  // and attach the layer but have it wait until the image is loaded before
  // it actually draws anything.

  // These are the variables that we will populate once the image is loaded.
